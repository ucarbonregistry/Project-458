Purpose of the project activity:
The project activity involves the installation of a biomass - based boiler with a total installed
capacity of 16 TPH. The project avoids use of coal as fuel in steam generation which would have
been the most preferred option in absence of the project activity. The main fuel types (biomass)
used are Corn cobs and groundnut shell. In the absence of this project activity, equivalent amount of
energy would have been generated from coal-based boiler which would spew the comparable
amount of GHG into the atmosphere. Hence, the implementation of this project activity leads to
reduction in GHG emissions associated with the coal-based steam generation.

Since these biomass fuel types are considered as renewable biomass, the thermal energy generated
from the project activity is considered as a clean form of energy. The project activity uses the
thermal energy generated for captive consumption within the plant, thereby it reduces significant
amount of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. The project activity would protect and conserve
the local environment by avoiding unintended emissions from the decay and uncontrolled burning
of biomass, which is a common practice in the region.

The project activity utilizes Corn cobs and groundnut shells as fuel which are considered waste by
the local farmers and are disposed of by burning in the fields due to the high cost of collection and
lack of economically viable options to utilize the same. This causes air pollution in the state of
Maharashtra.

The Project Activity is supposed to generate an average estimated emission reduction of about
34,702 tCO2e/year. The total estimated emission reduction for the entire duration of the crediting
period is 3,47,020 tCO2e.
